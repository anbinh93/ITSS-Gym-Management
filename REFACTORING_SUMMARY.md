## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
```
/be/
├── config/
│   └── seedData.js          # Centralized data constants
├── services/
│   └── DatabaseSeeder.js    # Modular seeding service
├── utils/
│   └── seedUtils.js         # Database utilities
└── seed.js                  # Main seed script (refactored)
```

### Frontend Enhancements
```
/fe/src/components/User/
└── Profile.jsx              # Enhanced with modern UI/UX
```

## 📈 Performance & Maintainability

### Benefits Achieved
