echo "üß™ FEEDBACK FEATURE TESTING SCRIPT"
echo "=================================="
echo ""
echo "This script provides a comprehensive testing checklist for the new feedback feature."
echo "Follow these steps to manually test the implementation:"
echo ""

echo "üìã PRE-TESTING SETUP"
echo "===================="
echo "1. ‚úÖ Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running"
echo "2. ‚úÖ Login as a coach account"
echo "3. ‚úÖ Ensure there are users with active memberships"
echo "4. ‚úÖ Create some workout sessions that users can check into"
echo ""

echo "üèãÔ∏è  COACH WORKFLOW TESTING"
echo "========================="
echo ""
echo "STEP 1: Session Management"
echo "- Navigate to Schedule Calendar as a coach"
echo "- Select a trainee who has workout sessions"
echo "- Verify sessions are displayed with correct statuses"
echo ""
echo "STEP 2: User Check-in Simulation"
echo "- Login as a user account (or simulate user check-in)"
echo "- Check into a scheduled workout session"
echo "- Return to coach view and verify session shows 'checked_in' status"
echo ""
echo "STEP 3: Quick Feedback Testing"
echo "- Find a session with 'checked_in' status"
echo "- Click the dropdown arrow next to 'Ho√†n th√†nh' button"
echo "- Test each quick feedback option:"
echo "  * üëç Ho√†n th√†nh t·ªët"
echo "  * ‚≠ê Xu·∫•t s·∫Øc"
echo "  * üìù C·∫ßn c·∫£i thi·ªán"
echo "- Verify session status changes to 'completed'"
echo "- Verify feedback appears in the session display"
echo ""
echo "STEP 4: Detailed Feedback Testing"
echo "- Find another session with 'checked_in' status"
echo "- Click 'Ho√†n th√†nh' button to open feedback modal"
echo "- Test modal functionality:"
echo "  * Verify modal opens with proper title and guidance"
echo "  * Try submitting with empty feedback (should be blocked)"
echo "  * Try submitting with < 10 characters (should be blocked)"
echo "  * Write detailed feedback (> 10 characters)"
echo "  * Verify character counter works"
echo "  * Submit feedback and verify success"
echo "- Verify session status changes to 'completed'"
echo "- Verify detailed feedback appears in session display"
echo ""

echo "üë§ USER WORKFLOW TESTING"
echo "======================="
echo ""
echo "STEP 5: User Feedback Viewing"
echo "- Login as the user whose sessions received feedback"
echo "- Navigate to Training Schedule"
echo "- Find completed sessions with feedback"
echo "- Verify feedback display:"
echo "  * Feedback appears in highlighted alert box"
echo "  * Coach feedback icon is visible"
echo "  * Feedback text is properly formatted"
echo "  * Line breaks are preserved"
echo "- Verify sessions without feedback don't show feedback box"
echo "- Verify incomplete sessions show notes differently"
echo ""

echo "üîß ERROR HANDLING TESTING"
echo "========================"
echo ""
echo "STEP 6: Validation Testing"
echo "- Test feedback modal validation:"
echo "  * Submit with empty feedback"
echo "  * Submit with very short feedback (< 10 chars)"
echo "  * Verify appropriate error messages/prevention"
echo "  * Test character limit (1000 characters)"
echo ""
echo "STEP 7: Network Error Simulation"
echo "- Temporarily disconnect internet/stop backend"
echo "- Try submitting feedback"
echo "- Verify error handling and user feedback"
echo "- Reconnect and verify functionality resumes"
echo ""

echo "üì± RESPONSIVE DESIGN TESTING"
echo "============================"
echo ""
echo "STEP 8: Mobile/Tablet Testing"
echo "- Test feedback modal on different screen sizes"
echo "- Verify dropdown functionality on mobile"
echo "- Ensure feedback display is readable on small screens"
echo "- Test touch interactions"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA"
echo "=================="
echo ""
echo "The feedback feature is working correctly if:"
echo "1. ‚úÖ Coaches can provide both quick and detailed feedback"
echo "2. ‚úÖ Feedback is saved and persisted in the database"
echo "3. ‚úÖ Users can view feedback prominently in their training schedule"
echo "4. ‚úÖ Feedback is distinguished from regular session notes"
echo "5. ‚úÖ Modal validation prevents invalid submissions"
echo "6. ‚úÖ Quick feedback options work and provide meaningful content"
echo "7. ‚úÖ Session statuses update correctly after feedback submission"
echo "8. ‚úÖ UI is responsive and works on different devices"
echo "9. ‚úÖ Error handling provides good user experience"
echo "10. ‚úÖ Real-time updates work (sessions refresh after feedback)"
echo ""

echo "üêõ ISSUE REPORTING"
echo "=================="
echo ""
echo "If you encounter any issues during testing:"
echo "1. Note the exact steps to reproduce the issue"
echo "2. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors"
echo "3. Check network tab for failed API requests"
echo "4. Note which user accounts and sessions were involved"
echo "5. Test if the issue occurs consistently or intermittently"
echo ""

echo "üìù TESTING COMPLETE"
echo "==================="
echo ""
echo "After completing all tests, the feedback feature should be fully"
echo "functional and ready for production use. This feature enhances"
echo "the coaching experience by enabling personalized feedback that"
echo "helps users understand their progress and improvement areas."
echo ""
echo "For any technical questions, refer to:"
